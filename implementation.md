# Implementation Plan

We plan to implement this project in several phases:

1. **Expansion of the digital twin platform**: Our team will create and test the first version of the platform, ensuring
   high reliability and usability.
2. **Onboarding of the first set of contributors**: We will reach out to potential contributors, provide them with our
   software, and start collecting anonymized health data.
3. **Implementation of the global early warning system**: Once we have a sufficient amount of data, we will begin
   offering early warnings for health threats.
4. **Continuous development and update**: We will continually enhance our software, offering new features and ensuring
   that our system stays at the forefront of digital health technology.
