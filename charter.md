# Project Proposal: AxoHealth DAO Digital Twin Network

## Executive Summary

The AxoHealth DAO aims to create a global realtime health early warning and optimisation system by utilizing the power of
Web3 technologies to create a decentralized autonomous organization. Our model is based on a digital twin platform for
health data analysis and early disease detection. Contributing entities, which could be individuals or hospitals, are
incentivized to contribute anonymized health data, enhancing the accuracy of our global early warning system. The base
currency of the DAO is the axtoken, which facilitates exchange of value within the ecosystem.

## Objective

Our primary objective is to build a global health monitoring and early warning system that utilizes the strength of Web3
and blockchain technologies for security and decentralization, combined with the sophistication of digital twin modeling
for predictive analysis.

## Project Description

AxoHealth DAO will provide digital twin software that can run standalone or in a cloud environment. This powerful tool
will enable users to create digital replicas of biological systems for the purpose of monitoring, simulation, and
predictive analysis.

Our contributing entities will include individuals and hospitals that create health data, which could encompass
symptoms, lab results, and more. We will ensure all data is anonymized before submission to maintain strict privacy
standards.

In return for their valuable contributions, entities will receive a subscription to the AxoHealth digital twin software
and axtokens. As long as they continue contributing data, they will receive regular updates that not only introduce new
features to the software but also provide early warnings for potential health threats in their region.

Should entities decide to discontinue their data contribution at any time, they will retain a perpetual license to
continue using the AxoHealth software. However, they will no longer receive software updates and regional alerts.

### Enablers

Enablers are providers of services to the AxoHealth network. Contributors can use axtokens to purchase services from
Enablers. Enablers might include software providers, hardware providers, medical labs for testing samples, transport
providers, systems integrators, and health researchers.

### Patrons

Patrons are entities or individuals that support the DAO through cash contributions or \"donations in kind\" of
services. This is what gives real-world value to the axtoken. Examples might include the World Health Organization (
WHO), the United Nations (UN), philanthropists, and deceased estates.

### Envoys

Envoys may be local, regional, or country-level entities that have responsibility for a jurisdiction. They receive a
subset of summary-level information for their jurisdiction. While they are unable to prevent information sharing, they
receive real-time information. They may also enable tokens that may be distributed in a restricted area.

## Benefits

This model offers several benefits:

1. **Collaboration**: The DAO structure allows for a collaborative and democratic ecosystem where all contributors have
   a stake in the global health monitoring system.
2. **Incentivization**: Contributors receive value in the form of cutting-edge digital twin software, continuous
   updates, and axtokens, fostering an environment of regular data submission.
3. **Privacy**: With our focus on data anonymization, we ensure that the privacy and security of contributors are never
   compromised.
4. **Early Detection**: Our global early warning system will provide timely alerts about potential health threats,
   enabling preventative measures and swift response.
5. **Perpetual Software Access**: Even if contributors decide to stop data submissions, they retain access to the
   software, ensuring ongoing value.

## Conclusion

We believe that AxoHealth DAO holds great potential in advancing global health monitoring and disease prevention. We
welcome contributions and look forward to building a healthier world together.
